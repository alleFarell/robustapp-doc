# Exception Handling

Exception handling in Java enables your programs to **respond gracefully to runtime errors**, improving both reliability and user experience. It’s especially important in ERP environments, where stability and predictable behavior are critical for business operations.

## Why Exception Handling Matters

In real-world applications, many things can go wrong:
- Missing or invalid user input
- File read/write failures
- Network outages
- Database connection issues

Without proper exception handling, these problems can **crash your application** or leave systems in an inconsistent state.

## Basic Try-Catch Structure

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup done");
}
```

- `try` – Code that might throw an exception
- `catch` – Block that handles the exception
- `finally` – Runs whether or not an exception occurs (often used for cleanup)

## Common Exception Types

| Exception Type         | Description                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `NullPointerException` | Accessing members on a `null` object        |
| `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` | Indexing past array length     |
| `IOException`          | File read/write errors                      |
| `SQLException`         | Database access issues                      |
| `IllegalArgumentException` | Invalid method input                    |

## ERP Use Cases

- 📥 **File Upload Validation:** Catch file format or size mismatches.
- 🧾 **Data Entry Errors:** Gracefully handle missing or malformed user input.
- 💾 **Database Operations:** Retry or rollback on connection or query failure.
- 🧹 **Batch Jobs:** Ensure logs are written and resources are closed even if the process fails.

---

## Best Practices

- ✅ Be specific: Catch exact exception types when possible.
- 🧼 Clean up resources using `finally` or try-with-resources.
- 🧭 Don’t silently ignore errors — always log them.
- 🔁 Consider retry logic for recoverable issues (e.g., network or temporary DB outages).
- 📦 Use **custom exceptions** to represent domain-specific failures (e.g., `InvalidInvoiceException`).

## Summary

Exception handling helps you build **fault-tolerant**, **user-friendly**, and **stable** applications — a must for ERP systems that handle sensitive and mission-critical operations.

> 🧠 **Tip:** Design your system to expect failure — catch exceptions, report them clearly, and recover wherever possible.
