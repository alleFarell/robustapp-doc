# Final Project and Assessment

Conclude your Java training by applying what you've learned to build a **mini-ERP solution**. This hands-on project will showcase your understanding of OOP, file handling, database integration, and error management in a real-world ERP scenario.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Design and implement a small-scale ERP-related tool using Java. It should simulate a business process such as tracking orders, managing inventory, or processing transactions.

---

## 💡 Project Ideas

Choose or adapt one of the following sample projects:

- **Customer Order Tracker**
  - Input: Order entries via console or CSV
  - Output: Generates summaries, flags delays, etc.

- **Inventory Level Notifier**
  - Reads stock levels and alerts when below threshold
  - Outputs logs or sends alerts (console/file/email)

- **Transaction Importer**
  - Imports sales or payment data from CSV
  - Validates and stores records in a database

Feel free to define your own project based on a real ERP problem you’d like to solve.

## Final Thoughts

This project is your opportunity to connect theory to practice and demonstrate how Java can be used to build ERP utilities that solve real business problems.

> 🧠 **Tip:** Focus on building something functional first. Once it works, refactor and polish!
