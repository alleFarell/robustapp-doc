## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you’ll understand:

- The significance of Java in enterprise and ERP environments
- The roles of the JDK, JRE, and JVM in the Java ecosystem
- How to write, compile, and run your first Java application
- Why Java is often chosen for scalable, secure business solutions

## Why Java Matters in ERP

Java is a cornerstone of many ERP solutions, especially in systems that require:

- Platform independence
- Strong performance and memory management
- Integration with APIs, services, or databases
- Custom desktop tools and middleware

📦 *Java is frequently used in building ERP plugins, data loaders, batch processors, and UI applications.*

## Key Components of the Java Ecosystem

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
  Contains tools and libraries needed for developing Java applications, including the compiler (`javac`).

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**  
  Allows you to run Java applications. It includes the JVM but not the development tools.

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**  
  Executes Java bytecode. It's what enables Java’s famous “write once, run anywhere” capability.

## Writing Your First Java Program

Here’s a basic example to get started:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
```

### Steps to Run:
1. Save the file as `HelloWorld.java`
2. Compile it with:
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```
3. Run it with:
   ```bash
   java HelloWorld
   ```

🧪 *You’ve just written your first Java program!*

## Recommended Tools

- **IDEs:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions
- **JDK Version:** Use LTS versions like Java 17 for stability
- **Build Tools:** Familiarize with Maven or Gradle for project management

## Summary

Java is a versatile and robust language that has stood the test of time in enterprise development. Its extensive libraries, community support, and cross-platform capabilities make it a natural fit for ERP-related applications and tools.

> 🧠 **Tip:** Set up a development environment early. The quicker you can write and test Java code, the faster you’ll learn and apply it to ERP scenarios.
